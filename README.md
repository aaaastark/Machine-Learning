# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of Computer Programs that can change when exposed to new data. Machine Learning in Python by using four python library (Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,Numpy and Seaborn).
# Installation Library of Python for Machine Learning
# Python Requires:
Python >=3.6 (version). I requre this libraries for Python (Python 3.9.0 - Oct. 5, 2020) version.
Note that Python 3.9.0 cannot be used on Windows 7 or earlier.
# Numpy:
Numpy Library Link: https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.19.3/
# Matplotlib:
Matplotlib Library Link: https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/3.3.3/
# Scikit-Learn:
Scikit-Learn Library Link: https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/0.23.2/
# Seaborn:
Seaborn Library Link: https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/0.11.0/

# Installation commond: Best for you both commond.
1: Download get-pip.py script to install pip:

/////// Commond_Console /////////

   Link:              curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   
   Install pip:       python get-pip.py
   
   Package Install:   python -m pip install <package-name>
   
                                    OR
                                    
                      pip install <package-name>
   
2: Python 3.9 is not even released for 10 days yet. As far as i see a lot of the packages are not supporting Python 3.9 yet. I think your best bet is to uninstall Python      3.9 and install Python 3.8.6. If you want you could try the following just to make sure, but i think i won't work.

     Install pip:          pip intstall pipwin
     
     Package Install:      pipwin install <package name>
